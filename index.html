        <h2>Welcome to my GitHub page!</h2>
        <p>Hey there, let me introduce myself: I'm Conny and I'm learning how
          to code. I've tried out a few things by now, including Python, SQL
          and the statistical programs R and Matlab, before settling on HTML
          and CSS for a deeper look. This page is one of the results so far.</p>
        <p>While I'm not currently working in web development, I still like to
          play around, so feel free to check out my example projects if you're
          interested! I started learning through a course on Codecademy and
          these were the results.</p>
        <p>Also, writing stories is a hobby of mine and just in case you like
          animals and fantasy, you're very welcome to take a look at and a read
          through my blog. It has yet to grow, since I just started it over a
          short while ago, but I hope I'll be able to post regularly soon.</p>
        <h3>Thank you for being here and have a nice day!</h3>
